Chapter 4: Legacy Owning
The fox and the seal continued their legacy. 

It has been three years since the circus started performing in Magic City. 
The Legacy Circus has built its reputation in the city, just as what the owner expected when he named it. 
The craze is enduring, with the queue of people outside the theatre stretching nearly 100 meters long to the Target Center. 
At the same time, the fox and the seal are now the most popular celebrities in the city. 
They decide to give back to the city whose citizens have been giving them a lot of support. 
So they decide to donate all their earnings to Macalester, to continue their legacy.
