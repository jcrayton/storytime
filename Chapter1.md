Chapter 1: The Seal will be Logical
The seal in the circus is very logical.
Its trainer gives it logic problems to solve for the audience.
The audience loves it because most seals aren't good at logic.
The for the first act, the seal solves a murder.
It uses logic that it learned in discrete to figure it out.
And, as it turns out, the murderer is in the crowd!
Thanks, logical seal.
